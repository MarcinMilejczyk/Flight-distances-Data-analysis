# Flight-distances-Data-Analysis

One of our large global financial clients spends millions of dollars a year on air travel. They believe that some of their contracted airlines are intentionally extending their quoted mileage for routes to lower the results of their cost-per-mile KPI, resulting in them appearing cheaper than the competition. Our company have therefore been tasked to track the point-to-point mileage between their top destinations and compare it to the mileage given by the carriers.

The first step of this is to establish the point-to-point distance between each of the airports given. Our company maintain a master list of airport latitude and longitude provided by the International Air Transport Association, and it is using this that we intend to calculate these distances so that they can be wrapped into a function and compared to the carrier-provided distances live in one of our analytics applications.
